      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey! My name is Drake Gooding and I'm 19 years old. I make music under the moniker 'In The Light' - which I stole from my favorite song of all time, 'In the Light' by Led Zeppelin. I'm currently learning how to read sheet music and play classical guitar. I want to learn how to write my own orchestral/classical pieces. I'm also in a coding bootcamp where I plan to learn the basics of development in order to work on building my idea for a blockcahin based music listening platform called Spyn. </p>

      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to run my own businesses while traveling the world and working on solving real world problems, such as plastic polution and space travel.</p>
